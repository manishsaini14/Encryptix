            <div class="about">
                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Mahatma Gandhi, born Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India, is
                    one of the most iconic leaders in world history. He is best known for his leadership in the Indian
                    independence movement against British colonial rule and his philosophy of nonviolent resistance, or
                    Satyagraha.</p>

            <div class="about">
                <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                <p>Gandhi was born into a Hindu family. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, was a government official, and
                    his mother, Putlibai, was a deeply religious woman whose spirituality influenced Gandhi's outlook on
                    life. Gandhi studied law in London, attending University College London, and became a barrister in
                    1891.</p>

                <h2>Time in South Africa</h2>
                <p>In 1893, Gandhi went to South Africa to work as a legal representative for an Indian firm. He stayed
                    there for 21 years, where he faced intense racial discrimination. The injustice against Indians and
                    Africans under colonial rule shaped his views on civil rights and equality. Gandhi began organizing
                    the Indian community in South Africa to protest unjust laws, which led to his development of
                    Satyagraha, a philosophy of nonviolent resistance to tyranny.</p>

                <h2>Role in Indian Independence Movement</h2>
                <p>After returning to India in 1915, Gandhi became a prominent figure in the struggle for independence
                    from British rule. He led several major campaigns that shook the foundation of the British Empire:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>1. Non-Cooperation Movement (1920–1922):</span><br>Gandhi called on Indians to boycott British
                    goods, institutions, and services, promoting the use of Khadi (hand-spun cloth) as a symbol of
                    self-reliance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>2. Salt March (1930):</span><br>Also known as the Dandi March, this was one of Gandhi’s most
                    famous acts of civil disobedience. He marched 240 miles to the Arabian Sea to make salt, defying
                    British laws that imposed a tax on salt production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>3. Quit India Movement (1942):</span><br>Gandhi and the Indian National Congress launched this
                    campaign demanding an end to British rule. Despite the arrests of Gandhi and many leaders, the
                    movement intensified the call for independence.

                <h2>Philosophy of Nonviolence</h2>
                <p>Gandhi’s principle of Ahimsa (nonviolence) was central to his approach. He believed that oppression
                    could be resisted without violence, and that moral force was stronger than physical force. His
                    philosophy influenced civil rights movements across the world, including those led by <strong>Martin
                        Luther
                        King Jr. </strong>and <strong>Nelson Mandela</strong> .</p>

            <div class="about">
                <h2>Personal Life and Beliefs</h2>
                <p>Gandhi lived simply, wearing a traditional dhoti and shawl, often spun by his own hands using a
                    charkha (spinning wheel). He promoted self-sufficiency, rural development, and cleanliness, and he
                    sought to eradicate the caste system, especially focusing on the upliftment of the Harijans (people
                    from the lowest castes, whom he referred to as "Children of God"). Gandhi also fasted on several
                    occasions to promote unity and peace between Hindus and Muslims in India.</p>

                <h2>Assassination</h2>
                <p>On January 30, 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, who opposed
                    Gandhi’s advocacy for Hindu-Muslim unity and his perceived concessions to Muslims during the
                    partition of India.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Mahatma Gandhi's legacy of nonviolent resistance and his role in securing India's independence made
                    him a global symbol of peace, tolerance, and justice. His birth anniversary, October 2, is observed
                    as Gandhi Jayanti in India and is also recognized internationally as the <strong>International Day of
                        Non-Violence</strong>.</p>
